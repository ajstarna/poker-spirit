Poker HUD

Requires Python 3.6+

hud.py gives a GUI
Currently it can only parse hands from Poker Stars. You need to enable saving hand history on Poker Stars, since hud.py will ask you for a file to analyze.

Also live_tracker_terminal.py allows for tracking a live game while it happens based on user input per action.
